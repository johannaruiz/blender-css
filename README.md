#Blender-CSS  
Have you always wanted the ability to use photoshop blending modes in the browser and on the web?  

Now you can with **Blender-CSS**, a simple set of snippets for you to use experimental css blending modes in the browser.
  
These are experimentals css features that currently only work in [Chrome Canary](http://google.ca/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html), [Webkit Nightly](http://nightly.webkit.org/builds/trunk/mac/1) and an experimental [Adobe browser](http://github.com/downloads/adobe/webkit/PrototypeEnhancementsForChromiumMac-may2012-f2f.zip)  

**Note:** You must enable experimental css features by typing **about:flags** in your address bar and **Enable CSS Shaders** (you may as well enable other CSS features that you'd like to play with since you're already there).
